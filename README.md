# Online Store â€“ React Ecommerce Project

This is a personal project: an online futsal shoe store inspired by *Orgland Sports*. I created it not only to practice **React** and **Redux**, but also because of my personal interest in futsal and to focus on **front-end development**.

The project includes product pages, an advanced product filtering system, shopping cart, synchronized product sliders, and a fully responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Features

- Built with **React** + **Redux Toolkit**  
- Styling with **Sass**  
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop  
- Shopping cart management system

- Shuffling products for sliders  
- Advanced product filtering (currently implemented with AI, planned to be rewritten with real API in the future)  
- Routing with **React Router**  
- Modular and clean code structure to avoid duplication
